#1
When creating derived classes remember always to implement virtual destructor and default contructor
#2
After adding new files or editing file localization always remember to add file path to CMakeLists.txt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#3
When loading a file You get "couldn't open .." and the path is correct and file is good it means that build directory is
other than loaded file. Make sure you have set up working directory so your program can use realative paths!

#FAQ#
1."Undefined reference to": it means that compiler cannot find definition of called reference.
  Reference to function. So linker found declaration of the function but no definition.
  If declaration are stored in header file and definitions in *.cpp file and linker still
  complains about undefined reference it means that your *.cpp is not linked to your compiler.
  Check your cmake file and make sure it contains all necessary *.cpp with correct path.
