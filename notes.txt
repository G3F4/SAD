1."Undefined reference to": it means that compiler cannot find definition of called reference.
  Reference to function. So linker found declaration of the function but no definition.
  If declaration are stored in header file and definitions in *.cpp file and linker still
  complains about undefined reference it means that your *.cpp is not linked to your compiler.
  Check your cmake file and make sure it contains all necessary *.cpp with correct path.
